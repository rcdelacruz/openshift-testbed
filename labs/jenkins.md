# Jenkins CI/CD Demo

## About Jenkins Pipeline Demo

On every pipeline execution, the code goes through the following steps:

1. Code is cloned from Gogs, built, tested and analyzed for bugs and bad patterns
2. The WAR artifact is pushed to Nexus Repository manager
3. A container image (_tasks:latest_) is built based on the _Tasks_ application WAR artifact deployed on WildFly
4. If Quay.io is enabled, the Tasks app container image is pushed to the quay.io image registry and a security scan is scheduled
5. The _Tasks_ container image is deployed in a fresh new container in DEV project (pulled form Quay.io, if enabled)
6. If tests successful, the pipeline is paused for the release manager to approve the release to STAGE
7. If approved, the DEV image is tagged in the STAGE project. If Quay.io is enabled, the image is tagged in the Quay.io image repository using [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo)
8. The staged image is deployed in a fresh new container in the STAGE project (pulled form Quay.io, if enabled)

## About the Deployment Pipeline

The following diagram shows the steps included in the deployment pipeline:

## About this Lab

The application used in this pipeline is a JAX-RS application which is available on GitHub and is imported into Gogs during the setup process:
[https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-tasks](https://github.com/OpenShiftDemos/openshift-tasks/tree/eap-7)

### Prerequisites

- 10+ GB memory

## Running this Lab

You can se the `scripts/provision.sh` script provided to deploy the entire demo:

```
./provision.sh --help
./provision.sh deploy
./provision.sh delete
```

## Demo Guide

- Take note of these credentials and then follow the demo guide below:

  - Gogs: `gogs/gogs`
  - Nexus: `admin/admin123`
  - SonarQube: `admin/admin`

- A Jenkins pipeline is pre-configured which clones Tasks application source code from Gogs (running on OpenShift), builds, deploys and promotes the result through the deployment pipeline. In the CI/CD project, click on _Builds_ and then _Pipelines_ to see the list of defined pipelines.

  Click on _tasks-pipeline_ and _Configuration_ and explore the pipeline definition.

  You can also explore the pipeline job in Jenkins by clicking on the Jenkins route url, logging in with the OpenShift credentials and clicking on _tasks-pipeline_ and _Configure_.

- Run an instance of the pipeline by starting the _tasks-pipeline_ in OpenShift or Jenkins.

- During pipeline execution, verify a new Jenkins slave pod is created within _CI/CD_ project to execute the pipeline.

- If you have enabled Quay, after image build completes go to quay.io and show that a image repository is created and contains the Tasks app image

- Pipelines pauses at _Deploy STAGE_ for approval in order to promote the build to the STAGE environment. Click on this step on the pipeline and then _Promote_.

- After pipeline completion, demonstrate the following:

  - Explore the _snapshots_ repository in Nexus and verify _openshift-tasks_ is pushed to the repository
  - Explore SonarQube and show the metrics, stats, code coverage, etc
  - Explore _Tasks - Dev_ project in OpenShift console and verify the application is deployed in the DEV environment
  - Explore _Tasks - Stage_ project in OpenShift console and verify the application is deployed in the STAGE environment
  - If Quay enabled, click on the image tag in quay.io and show the security scannig results

- Clone and checkout the _eap-7_ branch of the _openshift-tasks_ git repository and using an IDE (e.g. JBoss Developer Studio), remove the `@Ignore` annotation from `src/test/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/tasksrs/service/UserResourceTest.java` test methods to enable the unit tests. Commit and push to the git repo.

- Check out Jenkins, a pipeline instance is created and is being executed. The pipeline will fail during unit tests due to the enabled unit test.

- Check out the failed unit and test `src/test/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/tasksrs/service/UserResourceTest.java` and run it in the IDE.

- Fix the test by modifying `src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/tasksrs/service/UserResource.java` and uncommenting the sort function in _getUsers_ method.

- Run the unit test in the IDE. The unit test runs green.

- Commit and push the fix to the git repository and verify a pipeline instance is created in Jenkins and executes successfully.
