# Monitoring Kafka with Grafana and Prometheus

## About Grafana and Prometheus

Grafana is an open platform for beautiful analytics and monitoring. For more information please visit the [Grafana website](https://grafana.com/)

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. For more information please visit the [Prometheus website](https://prometheus.io/)

## About the Grafana Operator

The Grafana Operator in OperatorHub manages the full lifecycle for deploying and managing a Grafana instance on Kubernetes and OpenShift. The operator's goal is to reduce human configuration and maintenance activities by automating the tasks required when operating a Grafana cluster such as installing, upgrading, importing dashboards, importing data sources, and installing plugins.

See the [Official GitHub](https://github.com/integr8ly/grafana-operator) of the integr8ly grafana operator for more details
