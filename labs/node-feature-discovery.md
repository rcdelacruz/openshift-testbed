# Node Feature Discovery

## About the Node Feature Discovery Operator

The Node Feature Discovery Operator detects hardware features available on each node (i.e. GPU) in a Kubernetes cluster, and advertises those features using node labels. These labels can then be used to facilitate scheduling of workloads on OpenShift.

NFD runs in the background, re-labeling nodes every 60 seconds (by default) so that any changes in the node capabilities are detected [see link](https://docs.01.org/kubernetes/nfd/using.html)

## About this Lab

`openshift-testbed` automatically deploys and configures the nfd-operator as an argo application. You can immediately start to see detected node labels in your cluster once the operator is installed.

## Lab

### View Node Feature Discovery Operator

Navigate to the Installed Operators tab in the OpenShift UI in the `openshift-operators` project and select the Node Feature Discovery Operator:

Here you can see more detail about the Node Feature Discovery Operator such as status and health of components

Since the Operator starts working immediately after it is deployed, nodes in the cluster should already be labeled

### Viewing discovered node labels

In the OpenShift UI, navigate to Compute --> Nodes. Select a worker node and navigate to the YAML tab. Under labels, you should see labels discovered by the NFD Operator with the key starting with `feature.node.kubernetes.io`

## Conclusion

In this lab we have shown how to leverage the Node Feature Discovery Operator to detect and advertise node features using node labels.
